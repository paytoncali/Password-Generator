# Password-Generator

## Description 

This website was created to generate a random password for users. I worked on the Javascript for this project and the first thing I did was declare my variables. For this project, users were allowed to use either lower case letter, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters. My variables were an array of characters for each lower case letter, upper case letter, number and special characters. 

Once my inital variables were declared, I then began declaring additional varabiles to ask my users which variables they would like in there password as well as the length of the password. I then added if statements to confirm if their answer was true to store the array of characters selected into a new array. After this, I randomized the array and then split up the array into a string. Once in a string, I removed the commas in the string and finally pushed the users password into the HTML password ID to display the password on the webpage. 


## Usage 

The use of this program is to generate a random password for the user using lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters depending on what the user wants in their password.
